  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-xs-12">
      <p>Claire Cofelice is currently a sophomore studying communication design and
        art history at Washington University in St. Louis. When not in St. Louis, Claire lives with her parents, younger sister, and 7-year-old
        dachshund in a suburb outside of Boston. While her parents are Boston-born and raised, Claire considers herself a true Vermonter –
        after her dad decided to take a risk and begin working four hours north in the Green Mountain State, he and the rest of the family
        relocated from the suburbs of Central Massachusetts to Manchester, Vermont.</p>

    <div class="col-xs-12">
      <p>What was originally only supposed to be a short, year or two experience turned into an eight-year journey. During that entire time,
        Claire and her younger sister attended the same, small elementary through middle school – between all nine grades, there were only one hundred students
        at any given time. It was there that Claire first began to develop her love of everything art-related. Thanks to daily art classes, teachers who
        wore floral patterns and floppy hats to school everyday, and Vermont's admittedly crunchy granola culture, Claire was encouraged to spend her days
        throwing clay, weaving, painting, and more.</p>

    <div class="col-xs-12">
        <p>Now, even 6 years after moving away, the mountains still live on in her heart. It may be no surprise then, that, in her free time, Claire enjoys hiking, drawing, meditating, and cooking
          for her friends and family. After graduating, she hopes to stay in the city and take advantage of its growing arts community by pursuing a career
          at an interdisciplinary design firm.</p>
