<h3>Education</h3>
<p>Ever since I was in first grade, I have been a self-described nerd. I love reading and writing, doing math problems for fun, and conducting science experiments at my kitchen table.
  So unlike most kids in their early teens, I always loved going to school. High school, especially, was an important time for me, when I left behind my 10-person class for what I felt like what an enormous, 100-person class.
  In high school, I was involved in several organizations including Asian Culture Club, Sister to Sister, Calliope (a literary magazine), Achieve (a tutoring program), and I played several team sports.
  I also graduated with high distinction and was awarded the school's Purchase Prize for photography. Since being at WashU, I have been lucy enough to continue pursuing my high school extracurricular interets
in an academic setting. I have also gotten more involved on campus by becoming a member of our Theta Beta chapter of Kappa Delta, which organizes events throughout the year to support the Girl Scouts of America
as well as Prevent Child Abuse America, an organization founded by a WashU alum.</p>

<h3>Skills</h3>
<p>Because of how much time I've spent either in art classes or making art in my free time, I've picked up a few useful creative skills. More recently, I've also begun to really hone my abilities using Adobe's InDesign, Illustrator,
  and Photoshop.
